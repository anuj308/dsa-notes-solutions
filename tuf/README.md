# TUF Sheet – Solutions Guide

This folder contains solutions aligned to the TakeUForward (TUF) sheets.

## Structure

- Files are named by topic and progression order, e.g., `27BinarySeacrchTree.cpp`, `28GraphPart1.cpp`.
- At the top of many files, you’ll find the problem source link (LeetCode/GFG).
- Common local testing files:
  - `input.txt`: sample input used by tasks or manual runs
  - `output.txt`: captured output

## Running locally

- In VS Code, use the workspace task "Compile and run" to compile the currently open C++ file, feed `tuf/input.txt`, and write to `tuf/output.txt`.
- Or compile with your local compiler and run manually.

## Notes

- I aim to add time/space complexity notes at the top or bottom of each file.
- PRs/issues with better approaches or edge cases are welcome.
