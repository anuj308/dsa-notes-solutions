# Repository Overview

This repo is my consolidated DSA practice space. It includes:

- Daily problem solving from Striver A2Z and TUF sheets
- Topic-wise folders (arrays, trees, graphs, DP, etc.) inside `tuf/`
- Older practice sets in `c++/` and `dsa/`
- Language-specific practice in `java/` and `ts/`
- Notes and references (`notes.txt`, `Linux cmd.txt`, `sql.txt`)

## Navigation tips

- If youâ€™re browsing solutions from the TUF sheet, start in `tuf/` and open the numbered files by topic.
- For quick experiments or WIP code, check `tuf/demo.cpp` and `tuf/input.txt`/`output.txt`.
- For SQL/DBMS content, see `dbms/`.

## Conventions

- Most C++ files are single-problem, self-contained solutions.
- Where input is needed, `tuf/input.txt` is commonly used for local runs.
- Problem source links are placed as comments at the top of the file whenever possible.

## Roadmap snapshot

- Finish Graphs coverage, then DP
- Add time/space complexity to each solution
- Add small test cases next to problems where useful
