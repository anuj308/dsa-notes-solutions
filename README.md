# 🧩 Data Structures & Algorithms – Striver & TUF Sheets

Welcome to my DSA Practice Repository 🚀  
This repo contains my solutions, notes, and experiments while practicing Data Structures & Algorithms using Striver’s A2Z Sheet and TakeUForward (TUF) Sheet.

- Topics Covered So Far:
	- ✅ Arrays & Strings
	- ✅ Binary Search (20+ problems)
	- ✅ Recursion & Backtracking
	- ✅ Greedy Algorithms
	- ✅ Trees & Binary Search Trees
	- 🚧 Graphs (in progress)
	- ⏳ Dynamic Programming (next)

## 🧭 How to run solutions

- Open any C++ file and use the VS Code task: "Compile and run" (build group).  
- Inputs/outputs: many files use `tuf/input.txt` and write to `tuf/output.txt`.
- You can also compile with your preferred toolchain (GCC/Clang/MSVC) if you don’t use the provided task.

## 🚀 Future Goals

- Finish Graphs Section (currently in progress).
- Start Dynamic Programming (DP) section.
- Add complexity analysis (time & space) for every solution.
- Maintain weekly logs of progress here.
