# 🧩 Data Structures & Algorithms – Striver & TUF Sheets

Welcome to my DSA Practice Repository 🚀  
This repo contains my solutions, notes, and experiments while practicing Data Structures & Algorithms using Striver’s A2Z Sheet and TakeUForward (TUF) Sheet.

## 🧭 How to run solutions

- Open any C++ file and use the VS Code task: "Compile and run" (build group).  
- Inputs/outputs: many files use `tuf/input.txt` and write to `tuf/output.txt`.
- You can also compile with your preferred toolchain (GCC/Clang/MSVC) if you don’t use the provided task.

## Prompt for Copilot in VS Code

If you want Copilot to enrich this file further using actual repo details, you can paste this prompt in VS Code:

"Generate a professional README.md for this repository. It’s a DSA practice repo where I’m solving problems from Striver’s A2Z and TUF sheets. Include: progress summary, folder structure (based on files), languages used, links to my LeetCode & GitHub, and a future roadmap. Make it recruiter-friendly but concise." (See <attachments> above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again.)
