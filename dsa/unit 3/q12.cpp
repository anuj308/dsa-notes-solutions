// Single File Programming Question
// Problem Statement



// Lisa is organizing a list of scores of all subjects from her students and storing them in a deque. After collecting the total scores, she needs to determine the first score entered and the lowest score among all the scores. 



// Can you write a program to help Lisa by finding and printing both these values?

// Input format :
// The input consists of multiple integers representing student scores, terminated by -1.

// Output format :
// The output prints the first score entered and the lowest score among all the scores.



// Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

// Code constraints :
// 1 ≤ scores ≤ 1000

// Sample test cases :
// Input 1 :
// 34 27 96 47 -1
// Output 1 :
// First Element: 34
// Minimum Element: 27
// Input 2 :
// 28 67
// -1
// Output 2 :
// First Element: 28
// Minimum Element: 28
// Note :
// The program will be evaluated only after the “Submit Code” is clicked.
// Extra spaces and new line characters in the program output will result in the failure of the test case.
