// Single File Programming Question
// Problem Statement



// Ethan is working on a data analysis project that involves analyzing sales data from different regions. As part of his task, he needs to identify and display the data that has been sold the most using a double-ended queue (deque).



// Write a program that Ethan can use to find and print the product ID that has been sold the most. 

// Input format :
// The input consists of the product IDs representing the elements of the deque. The input is terminated by entering -1.

// Output format :
// The output prints the most repeated element in the given deque, along with the count.

// If no element is repeated, print the first element in the deque.



// Refer to the sample output for the exact text and format.

// Code constraints :
// 1 ≤ product ID ≤ 100

// Sample test cases :
// Input 1 :
// 12
// 54 
// 67
// -1
// Output 1 :
// Most Repeated Element is 12 with Count 1
// Input 2 :
// 11
// 15
// 15
// 22
// -1
// Output 2 :
// Most Repeated Element is 15 with Count 2
// Input 3 :
// 23
// 56
// 67
// 56
// 23
// 56
// -1
// Output 3 :
// Most Repeated Element is 56 with Count 3
// Note :
// The program will be evaluated only after the “Submit Code” is clicked.
// Extra spaces and new line characters in the program output will result in the fa
