// Single File Programming Question
// Problem Statement



// Sanju, an aspiring chef, decided to organize a cooking competition among his friends. He collected the scores of each participant and wanted to maintain a leaderboard using a max heap to easily retrieve the highest scores.



// After gathering the initial scores, Sanju realized he needed to add one more score to the heap. The program he wrote helps him insert the new score and display the updated leaderboard, ensuring the highest score is always at the top.

// Input format :
// The first line contains an integer n, representing the number of initial scores.

// The second line contains n space-separated integers, which are the initial scores.

// The third line contains an integer d, representing the new score to be inserted.

// Output format :
// The output displays n+1 space-separated integers representing the scores in the max heap after inserting the new score.



// Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

// Code constraints :
// 1 ≤ n ≤ 15

// 1 ≤ scores ≤ 250

// 1 ≤ d ≤ 250

// Sample test cases :
// Input 1 :
// 5
// 3 1 4 2 5
// 6
// Output 1 :
// 6 4 5 1 2 3 
// Input 2 :
// 7
// 25 12 18 7 14 21 9
// 15
// Output 2 :
// 25 15 21 14 12 18 9 7 
// Note :
// The program will be evaluated only after the “Submit Code” is clicked.
// Extra spaces and new line characters in the program output will result in the failure of the test case.
