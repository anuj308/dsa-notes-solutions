// Single File Programming Question
// Problem Statement



// Ram is working with a Max Heap to manage a set of numbers. He needs your help to build the heap, delete the root element, and calculate the sum of all remaining leaf nodes in the heap after the deletion. Your task is to:



// Insert numbers into a Max Heap.
// Print the Max Heap before and after deleting the root.
// Calculate and print the sum of all the leaf nodes in the heap after the root deletion.


// Help Ram perform these operations efficiently.

// Input format :
// The first line contains an integer n, representing the number of elements Ram will insert into the heap.

// The second line consists of n space-separated integers, representing the elements to be inserted into the heap.

// Output format :
// The output displays the following format:

// First, print the Max Heap before the root deletion on one line.

// Next, print the Max Heap after the root deletion on one line.

// Finally, print the sum of all leaf nodes in the format: "Sum of leaf nodes: X", where X is the computed sum.



// Refer to the sample output for the exact format.

// Code constraints :
// the test cases will fall under the following constraints:

// 1 ≤ n ≤ 10

// 1 ≤ values ≤ 100

// Sample test cases :
// Input 1 :
// 5
// 4 3 2 5 6
// Output 1 :
// 6 5 2 3 4 
// 5 4 2 3 
// Sum of leaf nodes: 5
// Input 2 :
// 6
// 4 5 6 3 2 1
// Output 2 :
// 6 4 5 3 2 1 
// 5 4 1 3 2 
// Sum of leaf nodes: 6
// Note :
// The program will be evaluated only after the “Submit Code” is clicked.
// Extra spaces and new line characters in the program output will result in the failure of the test case.
