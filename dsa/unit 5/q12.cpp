// Single File Programming Question
// Problem Statement



// David is a data analyst who often needs to analyze numbers by extracting their digits and sorting them in descending order. This will help him visualize the frequency of each digit and understand patterns within large numerical datasets.



// Write a program that takes a number as input, extracts its digits, sorts them, and displays the sorted digits as a single number using the heap sort algorithm.

// Input format :
// The input consists of an integer n, representing a single number.

// Output format :
// The output displays the digits of the number sorted in descending order as a single integer without any spaces.



// Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

// Code constraints :
// The test cases will fall under the following constraints:

// 2 ≤ n ≤ 109

// Sample test cases :
// Input 1 :
// 123
// Output 1 :
// 321
// Input 2 :
// 31524
// Output 2 :
// 54321
// Input 3 :
// 1001
// Output 3 :
// 1100
// Note :
// The program will be evaluated only after the “Submit Code” is clicked.
// Extra spaces and new line characters in the program output will result in the failure of the test case.
