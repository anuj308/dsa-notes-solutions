// Single File Programming Question
// Problem Statement



// Alex is a software engineer working on a project that involves processing user scores from an online gaming platform. He needs to create a max heap to efficiently manage these scores for ranking purposes. Additionally, Alex wants to analyze the performance of the top players by calculating the cube of their scores to get a better understanding of their performance metrics.



// Your task is to help Alex by implementing a program that builds a max heap from the input scores and prints the cubed values of these scores.

// Input format :
// The first line contains an integer N, representing the number of scores Alex will input.

// The second line consists of an N space-separated integers representing a user score.

// Output format :
// The first line displays the max heap in a single line, with scores separated by spaces.

// The second line displays the cubed values of the scores in the same order as they were input.



// Refer to the sample output for exact format specifications.

// Code constraints :
// The test cases will fall under the following constraints:

// 1 ≤ N ≤ 10

// 1 ≤ scores ≤ 30

// Sample test cases :
// Input 1 :
// 5
// 3 4 2 1 5
// Output 1 :
// 5 4 2 1 3 
// 125 64 8 1 27 
// Input 2 :
// 8
// 9 3 12 18 27 6 15 21
// Output 2 :
// 27 21 15 18 12 6 9 3 
// 19683 9261 3375 5832 1728 216 729 27 
// Note :
// The program will be evaluated only after the “Submit Code” is clicked.
// Extra spaces and new line characters in the program output will result in the failure of the test case.
