// Single File Programming Question
// Problem Statement



// Alice is a librarian who manages a collection of books in her local library. Each book has a unique identification number that represents its catalog entry. To improve the efficiency of the cataloging system, Alice needs to sort the identification numbers in ascending order for easier access and organization of books.



// Write a program that takes a list of book identification numbers as input and sorts them using the heap sort algorithm.

// Input format :
// The first line contains an integer n, representing the number of book identification numbers.

// The second line contains n integers id, representing the identification numbers of the books.

// Output format :
// The output displays the sorted book identification numbers in ascending order, each separated by a space.



// Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

// Code constraints :
// The test cases will fall under the following constraints:

// 2 ≤ n ≤ 10

// 1 ≤ id ≤ 1000

// Sample test cases :
// Input 1 :
// 5
// 0 1 0 1 0
// Output 1 :
// 0 0 0 1 1 
// Input 2 :
// 10
// 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
// Output 2 :
// 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 
// Note :
// The program will be evaluated only after the “Submit Code” is clicked.
// Extra spaces and new line characters in the program output will result in the failure of the test case.
