// Single File Programming Question
// Problem Statement



// Tao is a data analyst who has recently been tasked with organizing a list of survey responses. The responses include both even and odd integers representing different scores given by participants.



// To facilitate analysis, he wants to sort the scores into two separate groups: one for odd scores and another for even scores, each sorted in ascending order.



// Write a program that takes a list of integer scores as input, separates them into odd and even numbers, sorts each group using the heap sort algorithm, and then outputs the sorted lists.

// Input format :
// The first line contains an integer n, representing the total number of scores.

// The second line consists of n space-separated integers score, representing the score given by a participant.

// Output format :
// The output displays the sorted character names in alphabetical order, separated by a space.



// Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

// Code constraints :
// The test cases will fall under the following constraints:

// 2 ≤ n ≤ 10

// 1 ≤ Scores ≤ 1000



// Sample test cases :
// Input 1 :
// 10
// 9 3 2 1 5 6 7 8 10 4
// Output 1 :
// 1 3 5 7 9 
// 2 4 6 8 10 
// Input 2 :
// 5
// 6 7 8 3 2
// Output 2 :
// 3 7 
// 2 6 8 
// Note :
// The program will be evaluated only after the “Submit Code” is clicked.
// Extra spaces and new line characters in the program output will result in the failure of the test case.
