// Single File Programming Question
// Problem Statement



// Diego runs a candy shop, and he wants to arrange the candy boxes in non-decreasing order of their sweetness levels. He has a list of candies, where each candy's sweetness level is represented as an integer. Diego needs to sort these sweetness levels to display the candies from the least sweet to the most sweet.



// You need to help Diego by implementing a heap sort algorithm that will sort the list of candy sweetness levels in ascending order.

// Input format :
// The first line contains an integer n, representing the number of candy boxes.

// The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the sweetness levels of the candies.

// Output format :
// The output displays a single line of n space-separated integers representing the sorted sweetness levels in ascending order.



// Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

// Code constraints :
// The test cases will fall under the following constraints:

// 1 ≤ n ≤ 10

// 1 ≤ sweetness level of candies ≤ 1000

// Sample test cases :
// Input 1 :
// 5
// 275 635 987 145 325
// Output 1 :
// 145 275 325 635 987 
// Input 2 :
// 8
// 44 52 63 95 98 74 36 65
// Output 2 :
// 36 44 52 63 65 74 95 98 
// Note :
// The program will be evaluated only after the “Submit Code” is clicked.
