// Single File Programming Question
// Problem Statement



// Meet Jordan, a budding programmer who wants to implement a Max Heap data structure to manage a collection of integers.



// Jordan aims to develop a program that enables the insertion of elements into the Max Heap, displays the heap, and includes a feature to delete the most recently inserted element from the already displayed Max Heap.

// Input format :
// The first line contains an integer n representing the number of elements to be inserted into the Max Heap.

// The second line consists of n space-separated integers value that represents the value to be inserted into the heap.

// Output format :
// The first line should show the Max Heap after all elements have been inserted and the heap has been constructed.

// The second line should indicate that the last inserted element has been removed from the previously displayed Max Heap.



// Refer to the sample output for the exact format.

// Code constraints :
// the test cases will fall under the following constraints:

// 1 ≤ n ≤ 10

// 1 ≤ values ≤ 100

// Sample test cases :
// Input 1 :
// 5
// 4 3 2 5 6
// Output 1 :
// 6 5 2 3 4 
// 6 5 2 3 
// Input 2 :
// 6
// 4 5 6 3 2 1
// Output 2 :
// 6 4 5 3 2 1 
// 6 4 5 3 2 
// Note :
// The program will be evaluated only after the “Submit Code” is clicked.
// Extra spaces and new line characters in the program output will result in the failure of the test case.
