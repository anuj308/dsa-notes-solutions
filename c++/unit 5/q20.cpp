// ingle File Programming Question
// Problem Statement



// Alex, an avid reader, has just finished a captivating book and wants to keep a record of its essential details, including the title, author, and year of publication.



// To achieve this, he decides to develop a program utilizing a Book class that employs a dynamic constructor for memory allocation of the book's attributes.



// This program will enable him to easily update the year of publication when necessary. The class features several functions: a constructor to initialize the book's details, a setYear(int newYear) method to modify the publication year, a getYear() method to retrieve it, and a displayDetails() method to showcase the book's information effectively.

// Input format :
// The first line contains the title of the book as a string.

// The second line contains the author's name as a string.

// The third line contains the year of publication as an integer.

// The fourth line contains the updated year of publication as an integer.

// Output format :
// The output displays the book details in the following format:



// The title of the book.
// The author's name.
// The original year of publication.
// The updated year of publication.


// Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

// Code constraints :
// The title and author's name should be at most 100 characters each.

// 0000 ≤ The year of publication ≤ 2999

// Sample test cases :
// Input 1 :
// Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
// J K Rowling
// 1997
// 1998
// Output 1 :
// Title: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
// Author: J K Rowling
// Year of Publication: 1997
// Updated Year of Publication: 1998
// Note :
// The program will be evaluated only after the “Submit Code” is clicked.
// Extra spaces and new line characters in the program output will result in the failure of the test case.
